Did Buffon, in 1783
not foresee this
when he wrote this magnificent sentence
about a complex and chaotic world
that on has to try to understand globally?

"Everything happens,
because with time everything meets,
and in the free range of spaces
and in the continuous succession of movement,
all matter is stirred,
any form given,
all figures printed;
so everything is coming or going,
all is joined or running away,
all is combined or opposed,
everything happens or is destroyed
by relative or contrary forces,
that are the only constants,
and balancing without harm,
they animate the universe
and make it into a theater
with ever new scenes
and objects incessantly reborn"

世界万物运转无止息，万物都在的世间洪流中相遇
在广袤无尽的空间中，以及物换星移的接轨瞬间
万物混成冥河，不拘任何形体，不拘任何被赋予的形象
因此，万事万物或相近，或远离，或合一，或分离
或相容，或相斥，或生，或灭，恒久不变的，只有交互作用的力
恣意横行，却灵巧而不自伐，为宇宙燃起生命气息，让生命舞台上
无时无刻上演着新的戏码，写下生生不息，永无止境的诗篇
